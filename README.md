# Power of Python in GIS
This repository has been created to host material, demonstrating the power of Python for GIS and Geosciences. Originally it is meant for a presentation to the PhD students at the faculty of Geosciences of Utrecht University.

- Within the folder <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/gis-python-power/tree/main/notebooks">**notebooks**</a> there are available all the jupyter notebooks that have been used during the workshop.
- The folder <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/gis-python-power/tree/main/playbooks">**playbooks**</a> is exclusively dedicated for the creation of the digital workspaces that have been used from the participants throughout the workshop's practical sessions for Raster and Vector data.
